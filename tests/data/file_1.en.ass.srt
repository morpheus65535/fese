00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,990
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Why? Why won't you come?</font>

2
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,530
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">I wish you would come here...</font>

3
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,650
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Look! Look at that!</font>

4
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,190
<font face="Inkburrow" size="54" color="#000000">Why you should do that...</font>

5
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,240
<font face="Inkburrow" size="54" color="#000000">...is something you should figure out for yourself.</font>

6
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:22,970
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Gotcha!</font>

7
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,270
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Hey, cut it out!</font>

8
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,100
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Why?</font>

9
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,860
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Don't!</font>

10
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,650
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">What's the problem? Don't play hard to get!</font>

11
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,690
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Come on, let's go someplace happy.</font>

12
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,030
<font face="Inkburrow" size="54" color="#000000">I...</font>

13
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,910
<font face="Inkburrow" size="54" color="#000000">...don't need to stay in a place like this.</font>

14
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,990
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">What the hell?</font>

15
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,820
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">What happened?!</font>

16
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,580
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">W-We don't know anything! W-We've got nothing to do with this!</font>

17
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,740
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">She came outta nowhere...</font>

18
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,380
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Oh, no...</font>

19
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,090
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Damn it...</font>

20
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,720
<font face="Inkburrow" size="54" color="#000000">If you stay in a place like this...</font>

21
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,430
<font face="Inkburrow" size="54" color="#000000">...you might not be able to connect.</font>

22
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,460
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">What a racket...</font>

23
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,510
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Can't you be quiet?</font>

24
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,580
<font face="Inkburrow" size="54" color="#000000">Everybody, hurry...</font>

25
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,370
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Juri, don't make such a big deal about it.</font>

26
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,910
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Yeah, it's just some stupid prank.</font>

27
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,700
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">B-But...</font>

28
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,500
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">It'll be okay.</font>

29
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,430
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Lain?</font>

30
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,890
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Did you get one, too?</font>

31
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,520
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Get what?</font>

32
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,140
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">E-mail!</font>

33
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,150
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">E-mail?</font>

34
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,770
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">From Yomoda Chisa!</font>

35
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,030
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">I... I'm not very good with computers.</font>

36
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,910
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">You should at least check your mail once a day.</font>

37
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,700
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Well, it's up to you, I guess.</font>

38
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,660
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Lain's such a baby.</font>

39
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,750
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Why is she crying?</font>

40
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,090
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Because she got an e-mail from Yomoda Chisa, that's why!</font>

41
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,760
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Chisa? Who's that?</font>

42
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,180
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">She was in class D.</font>

43
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,760
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">She killed herself last week by jumping off a building in Shibuya.</font>

44
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,890
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Come on, the teacher told everybody!</font>

45
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,350
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">It's not just Juri.</font>

46
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,900
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Lots of people have gotten mail from her this week.</font>

47
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,070
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">But she's...</font>

48
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,770
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Right. You shouldn't be getting mail from a dead girl.</font>

49
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,780
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">But there it is.</font>

50
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,660
<font face="Inkburrow" size="54" color="#000000">What's it like when you die?</font>

51
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,620
<font face="Inkburrow" size="54" color="#000000">It really hurts. :)</font>

52
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,820
<font face="Tahoma" size="32" color="#aeacc5">Powering up... Working...</font>

53
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,970
<font face="Tahoma" size="32" color="#aeacc5">Just a little longer...</font>

54
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,240
<font face="Tahoma" size="32" color="#aeacc5">Log in.</font>

55
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,950
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Who are you?</font>

56
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,760
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Lain. Please say your name.</font>

57
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,050
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">La-i-n.</font>

58
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,690
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Accepted.</font>

59
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,830
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">You must be Lain.</font>

60
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,850
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Lain has mail.</font>

61
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,940
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">From who?</font>

62
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,110
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Yomoda Chisa.</font>

63
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,360
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Do you wish to read your mail?</font>

64
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,950
<font face="Tahoma" size="32" color="#aeacc5">Hello, how are you?</font>

65
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,590
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Hello.</font>

66
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,320
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">How are you?</font>

67
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:26,750
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Lain, I walked home with you just once. Do you remember?</font>

68
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:34,380
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">I have only given up my body.</font>

69
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,200
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">By doing this, I can explain to you that I am still alive.</font>

70
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,640
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">I wanted to let you know this, Lain, so I sent this e-mail to you.</font>

71
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,810
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Do you understand? It's okay if you can't right now.</font>

72
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,320
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">You will all understand soon. Everyone will.</font>

73
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,630
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Why did you die?</font>

74
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,790
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Rumor at school has it that this is a prank e-mail,</font>

75
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,060
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">but I want you to know that it isn't, Lain.</font>

76
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,230
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Why? Why did you die?</font>

77
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,280
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">God is here.</font>

78
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,180
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Huh?</font>

79
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,290
<font face="Tahoma" size="32" color="#aeacc5"><font color="#61d0e4">God...</font></font>

80
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,590
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">I ate lunch late today. I'm done.</font>

81
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,640
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Mom?</font>

82
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,930
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Yes?</font>

83
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,680
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">I got an e-mail.</font>

84
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,520
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">From a girl who killed herself last week.</font>

85
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,300
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">What is it, Lain?</font>

86
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,910
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">It's certainly unusual to see you in here.</font>

87
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,510
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">I...</font>

88
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,040
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">I was wondering if you could buy me a new Navi...</font>

89
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,610
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Finally caught the bug, huh?</font>

90
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,010
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">You're in junior high now.</font>

91
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,010
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Your friends are leaving you in the dust, right?</font>

92
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,940
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">I keep telling you that you should use a better machine.</font>

93
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,150
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">You know, Lain, in this world,</font>

94
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,950
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">whether it's here in the real world or in the Wired,</font>

95
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:09,030
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">people connect to each other, and that's how societies function.</font>

96
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,040
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Even a girl like you can make friends right off the bat, Lain.</font>

97
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,900
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">There's nothing to be afraid of.</font>

98
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,120
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">I wonder why your mother can't understand that?</font>

99
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,170
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">I'm not scared.</font>

100
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,720
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">But why bring up your Navi all of a sudden?</font>

101
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,080
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">There's a friend I want to see.</font>

102
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,920
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">What happened?</font>

103
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,920
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Damn it...</font>

104
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,650
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">We apologize for the inconvenience, ladies and gentlemen.</font>

105
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,380
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">The train is currently stopped due to an accident.</font>

106
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,760
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">What?</font>

107
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,260
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Was someone hit?</font>

108
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,970
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">I can't believe this...</font>

109
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,340
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Miss Iwakura.</font>

110
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,580
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Miss Iwakura.</font>

111
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,310
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Yes, ma'am.</font>

112
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,580
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">This will be on the test.</font>

113
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,490
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Come to the Wired as soon as you can.</font>

114
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:55,210
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">{\an8}Come to the Wired as soon as you can.</font>

115
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,090
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Chisa?</font>

116
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,760
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Where are you?</font>

117
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,790
<font face="Myriad Pro" size="44">Wait!</font>
